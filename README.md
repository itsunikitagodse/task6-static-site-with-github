## How It Works

1. The `index.html` file is the entry point for the website.
2. Styling is handled through `style.css`.
3. GitHub Pages serves the files directly from the `main` branch.

## How to Run Locally

git clone https://github.com/your-username/static-website.git
cd static-website
open index.html  # Or double-click to open in browser
